# surFami, a SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator

SNES has always fascinated me. I've never owned it. My parent's approach to what contains electronics inside was too demonizing; moreover, we had only one television at home, and its only purpose was to show a movie in the evening and only on the national channels. I think that mobile phones are a different matter, today, and their size and approachable cost is the real trojan horse for their mass diffusion. Anyway, my parents would have never bought something whose unique use was to play videogames (videogames are evil, you know. This is probably the reason why I'm still playing them now that I am 47).<br/><br/>

So, with those premises, i *had* to write a SNES emulator.<br/><br/>
