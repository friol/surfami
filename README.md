# surFami, a SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) emulator

SNES has always fascinated me. I've never owned it. My parent's approach to what contains electronics inside was too demonizing; moreover, we had only one television at home, and its only purpose was to show a movie in the evening and only on the national channels. I think that mobile phones are a different matter, today, and their size and approachable cost is the real trojan horse for their mass diffusion. Anyway, my parents would have never bought something whose unique use was to play videogames (videogames are evil, you know. This is probably the reason why I'm still playing them now that I am 47).<br/><br/>

So, with those premises, i *had* to write a SNES emulator.<br/><br/>

SNES is not that hard to emulate, at the end. Beware, emulating it accurately would require a whole lot of effort (years, if not decades, if you think of something like https://github.com/higan-emu/higan).<br/>
That's not the aim of surFami. I just wanted to hack together an app to demonstrate that in a few months you can create a working SNES emu. I think I succeeded.<br/>
I've spent about 2 months and a half on surFami (as you can see from the commit history), and, as always, working on it only in my free time.
